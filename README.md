# Movie Night #
Movie Night app is a front-end single page application built with Angular.
- First Angular app built for coding excercise


## Login Page ##
For this coding excersice I did not use any libraries for use authentication. It's just basic logic to mimic a user authentication.

Demo Login
- username: test
- password: 123

- Each Movie title is Clickable

## Full C.R.U.D ##
To simulate communication with a remote data server I used In-Memory Web API which allows me to make RESTful Api's request without spinning up my own server.

- User is able to Post, Read, Update and Delete movies

## Mobile Responsive ##
For styling I used Angular Material UI as well as Flex-layout for my components.
